![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adikm/golang-vs-java)

Inspired by [driver733/kotlin-vs-java](https://github.com/driver733/kotlin-vs-java) and [fabiomsr/from-java-to-kotlin](https://github.com/fabiomsr/from-java-to-kotlin)

# Development

1. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

    `brew install hugo`
2. Run `hugo server` inside the project root directory.

# Adding new code
The code snippets are placed inside the content directory. They are grouped by categories. Each code snippet has its counterpart in GoLang and Java.

If you want to add a new snippet, just create "snippet.go" and "snippet.java", then include it in the suitable markdown template file.

You can create new category by creating a new folder and a new markdown template.

# Contribution
